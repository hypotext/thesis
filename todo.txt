TODO 4/9/16

- oracleMap (compFold) ~ oc_compMap / oracleCompMap_inner (extra (nat, KV)) 
  need to prove the equivalent of compFold_oc_equiv_h for ocmi?
  but 
- trying to prove the PRF-only gi_normal_rb_eq 
  - induction breaks with noV, so take it off (calls > 1), induct on remaining, and put it back on?
  - induction breaks with geneal init acc for compFold vs. nil acc for ocmi -- adam solves it with appending a list on front (can let both be nil in my specific case)
- after i prove ^ (by generalizing acc, reproving compFold_oc_equiv_h but abstracting the specific computations) -- then what? try proving RB-only, then relating the individual genupdate oracles (see other TODO)?

- prove Gi_normal_rb_eq (?)
  - does this one require an induction??

- write up oraclecompmap proof before i forget it

- see other TODO
- and workflowy TODO
