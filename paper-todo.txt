HAVE A DRAFT FOR ANDREW BY FRIDAY, 8 AM.!!!!

Goal for Friday (done by midnight, needs to be turn-in-able):

- Interstitial paragraph on my approach to summarizing formal stuff
- Rewrite in 2-column <-- Just for the stuff I have already (PRF_DRBG ideal/real world def / adversary / 2 games, same for the other one)

- Lemma outline with short summary in body of paper
  - Tree diagram
- Edit lemmas for correctness
- Move lemmas to appendix

- Write section on stuff verification helped me catch
- Write section on specifically annoying reasoning, pointing to list of lemmas

Goal for Saturday: -- should be able to turn it in by 8pm/10pm!!

- Estimate failure probability (15)
- Move NoV presentation
- Typesetting (Andrew's edits), ToC
- Typesetting (line breaks; code; real-world/ideal-world)
- Move to BibTex? At least fix references (intro)
- Edit intro/conclusion/prior work
- Go through and remove inline/commented TODOs, weird symbols in source
- Print and edit

--

- Label tables (list of tables)
- Fix abstract
- Fix introduction
- Fix conclusion

- Replace dupsInIthInputCalls.* everywhere by hasDups, and explain it
  - also rf_withDups (e.g. Gi_rb_rf_no_bad_same)
- Fix "appending"
- Flesh out explanation of collisions lemmas (didn't I already do this? integrate)
- Add sections on "not being able to prove this helped me find these errors in my code" and "formal methods made us think about these theorems"
- Cite entropy extractor paper and summarize

- Cite Naphat
- Indistinguishability -> pseudorandomness
- Fix Pr_1 notation
- PRNG -> PRG, DRBG
- Math font -> serif
- Listings font -> sans serif
- PRF_A -> A_{PRF}
- G_real -> G_{mathit{real}} and also for ideal
- Fix hyphens
- Fix architecture diagram
- Change distinguishers D to adversaries A
- Other misc (look through the marked-up paper)
- Add evaluation questions
- Talk about the DRBG complexities we glossed over

- Go through meeting notes to see what I missed
- Read EasyCrypt https://www.easycrypt.info/downloads/tutorial/tutorial-prg.pdf
- Cite Bellare/Rogaway for game playing
- Even out the level of detail throughout the paper
- Security parameter eta
- Cite Coq names in crypto proofs

Presentation:

- MODEL PAPER: the HMAC paper honestly
- Look at EasyCrypt paper and how people handle games
- Look at the Oakland papers he sent me
- Also the Bellare/Rogaway paper on block ciphers
- Side-by-side comparison of real-world and ideal games (see papers)

------

Bucket list:

- ACTUALLY FINISH PROOFS AND CLEAN UP CODE
- We can't verify these systems because they're broken
  - Breaking ElGamal
  - Or some PRG we come up with
- Tailor background to the conference
- Read Naphat's paper
- Get it printed and bound

---

Andrew's edits

- Move to new format
  - Merge formal section and Coq section (2-column)
  - Rename Coq code
- Diagram of proof structure (could be ToC)
  - Asterisk the unfinished ones
- Estimate actual failure probability (Adam/Matt: PRF_Advantage)
- Summarize more of Barthe's stuff
- Move noV presentation
- Move to BibTeX and make a final pass through citations
- New proof for real Instantiate
- Fix all labels and references
