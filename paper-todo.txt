- Explain PRF_Adv_eq_until_bad, oracleCompMap__oracle_eq_until_bad_dups
  - and the corresponding lemmas PRF_A_randomFunc_eq_until_bad and fcf_oracle_eq_until_bad (Adam's work)

- Explain Gi_rb_normal
  - Look at / count what other substantial lemmas I have, or if this is the last??

- Write out the collisions intermediate games
  - Explain Adam's proof (did I already do that?)
 
- Replace dupsInIthInputCalls.* everywhere by hasDups, and explain it
  - also rf_withDups (e.g. Gi_rb_rf_no_bad_same)

- Diagram of lemma structure

- Fully write out informal proof as a crypto proof
  - Look at model papers

- Add sections on "not being able to prove this helped me find these errors in my code" and "formal methods made us think about these theorems"

------

Later:

- Explain HMAC_DRBG
- Explain FCF
- Explain PRHL and comp_spec
- Write a worked example of a Coq proof
- ACTUALLY FINISH PROOFS AND CLEAN UP CODE
- Go through meeting notes to see what I missed
- Comment on what was hybrid-specific work (i.e. hard induction) -- note it in the diagram
- Read EasyCrypt https://www.easycrypt.info/downloads/tutorial/tutorial-prg.pdf

------

Bucket list:

- We can't verify these systems because they're broken
  - Breaking ElGamal
- Tailor background to the conference
- Appendix with code
- Move to a real TODO system
- Move to BibTeX
