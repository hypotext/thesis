4/14/16, 2:30 AM...

- Write HMAC-DRBG overview
- ???
  - Name lemmas to refer to them

- Put in edits
  - Fix "equivalent" -> "identically distributed"

- Fully write out informal proof as a crypto proof
  - Well, first write it out on paper...
  - Look at model papers
  - Indistinguishability AND backtracking resistance

(  - But I already wrote a bunch of stuff??
  - The code level of detail is too great
  - I guess I want to start at code level for the definitions for both, but then do a crypto-paper-style proof outline for the former, and a detailed Coq exposition for the latter -- and I'm not even done... 
  - I'd just feel weird copying-and-pasting half a page of code
  - I mean do I really have to close-read and explain the Coq??)

TODO: I don't even understand PRHL... ask Lennart to explain the rules to me?

-------

- Write out the collisions intermediate games <-- 0.5 pages
  - Explain Adam's proof (did I already do that?)
 
- Diagram of lemma structure <-- 0.5 pages

==== 4 pages (which is probably fine for this Friday)

- Add sections on "not being able to prove this helped me find these errors in my code" and "formal methods made us think about these theorems"

- Replace dupsInIthInputCalls.* everywhere by hasDups, and explain it
  - also rf_withDups (e.g. Gi_rb_rf_no_bad_same)

- Read the HMAC paper

- PROPERLY NAME AND REFER TO MY LEMMAS

------

Later:

** - Incorporate Andrew's edits
- Write conclusion
- Explain PRHL and comp_spec
- Explain HMAC_DRBG
- Explain FCF
- Comment on what was hybrid-specific work (i.e. hard induction) -- note it in the diagram
- Write a worked example of a Coq proof
- Talk about the DRBG complexities we glossed over
- Lemma "table of contents" (quick summary)?

- ACTUALLY FINISH PROOFS AND CLEAN UP CODE
- Go through meeting notes to see what I missed
- Read EasyCrypt https://www.easycrypt.info/downloads/tutorial/tutorial-prg.pdf
- Cite Bellare/Rogaway for game playing
- Even out the level of detail throughout the paper
- Security parameter eta
- Cite Coq names in crypto proofs

Presentation:

- Look at Mario's paper
- MODEL PAPER: the HMAC paper honestly
- Look at EasyCrypt paper and how people handle games
- Look at the Oakland papers he sent me
- Also the Bellare/Rogaway paper on block ciphers
- Side-by-side comparison of real-world and ideal games (see papers)

------

Bucket list:

- We can't verify these systems because they're broken
  - Breaking ElGamal
  - Or some PRG we come up with
- Tailor background to the conference
- Appendix with code
- Move to a real TODO system
- Move to BibTeX
- Read Naphat's paper
- Get it printed and bound
