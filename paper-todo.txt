- Explain PRF_Adv_eq_until_bad, oracleCompMap__oracle_eq_until_bad_dups
  - and the corresponding lemmas PRF_A_randomFunc_eq_until_bad and fcf_oracle_eq_until_bad (Adam's work) <-- 1.5 pages

- Explain Gi_rb_normal <-- 0.5 pages
  - Look at / count what other substantial lemmas I have, or if this is the last??

- Fully write out informal proof as a crypto proof <-- 1 page ***
  - Well, first write it out on paper...
  - Look at model papers
  - Indistinguishability AND backtracking resistance

-------

- Write out the collisions intermediate games <-- 0.5 pages
  - Explain Adam's proof (did I already do that?)
 
- Diagram of lemma structure <-- 0.5 pages

==== 4 pages (which is probably fine for this Friday)

- Add sections on "not being able to prove this helped me find these errors in my code" and "formal methods made us think about these theorems"

- Replace dupsInIthInputCalls.* everywhere by hasDups, and explain it
  - also rf_withDups (e.g. Gi_rb_rf_no_bad_same)

- Read the HMAC paper

------

Later:

- Explain PRHL and comp_spec
- Explain HMAC_DRBG
- Explain FCF
- Comment on what was hybrid-specific work (i.e. hard induction) -- note it in the diagram
- Write a worked example of a Coq proof
- Talk about the DRBG complexities we glossed over
- Lemma "table of contents" (quick summary)?

- ACTUALLY FINISH PROOFS AND CLEAN UP CODE
- Go through meeting notes to see what I missed
- Read EasyCrypt https://www.easycrypt.info/downloads/tutorial/tutorial-prg.pdf
- Cite Bellare/Rogaway for game playing
- Even out the level of detail throughout the paper

Presentation:

- Look at Mario's paper
- MODEL PAPER: the HMAC paper honestly
- Look at the Oakland papers he sent me
- Also the Bellare/Rogaway paper on block ciphers
- Side-by-side comparison of real-world and ideal games (see papers)

------

Bucket list:

- We can't verify these systems because they're broken
  - Breaking ElGamal
  - Or some PRG we come up with
- Tailor background to the conference
- Appendix with code
- Move to a real TODO system
- Move to BibTeX
- Read Naphat's paper
- Get it printed and bound
