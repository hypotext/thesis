9/30/15
* cloned FCF and got it to check
* TODO read ElGamal

9/31/15
* nothing

8/1/15
* started responding to naphat's email
* read his notes
* starting to write email for next week's meeting
* proposal is due next tuesday
  (I should send it Monday morning)
* TODO make a comprehensive TODO list
* TODO thesis every day
* TODO learn probability. read proofs.
* TODO send these two emails ASAP

8/2/15
* responded to naphat's email
* made comprehensive TODO list
* wrote proposal except for related work

8/3/15
* finished proposal and sent it
* sent meeting email
* started reading fcf paper, realized it's not the most impt. thing right now
* read next two pages of HMAC-DRBG paper. lucid up to proof. is it game-based?

8/4/15
* nothing, clashed with ELE pset and CWR assignment

8/5/15
* checked out the two crypto coursera classes; decided on boneh's; watched most of the first lecture on PRGs
* submitted project proposal
* GOAL: watch coursera videos, do the exercises, be able to point to a specific area of HMAC proof that I'm stuck on.

8/6/15
* none, opted to work in morning instead

8/7/15
* morning: finished PRG intro, watched first half of PRG security definitions. we're proving security GIVEN THAT HMAC is secure (given that hash function is secure). actual security would imply P != NP
* night: (~3.5 hrs)
  - finished PRG security defs: adversary as statistical test, secure IFF unpredictable (Yao's theorem)
  - realized that goldwasser (?)'s book is a real and long textbook, not just the 30 pages of notes i have. ordered/downlowded it
  - checked out HMAC proof 1: confusing
  - checked out HMAC proof 2: lucid! random oracle model bad? 
    - hash-based DRBG proof first, then HMAC's?
* TODO: HMAC proof 2, semantic security, el-gamal, game-based crypto reduction proofs, goldwasser book, **figure out where i get stuck on a proof**

8/8/15
* good progress: read HMAC proof 2 paper and understood the proofs.
* they were surprisingly simple. converting random oracle model proofs to game-based proofs? how does this differ from HMAC proof 2? can this be formalized?
* HMAC-DRBG algorithm itself is surprisingly simple: V_{i+1} = HMAC(K, V_i); bits_{i+1} = bits_i || V_{i+1}.
* TODO: write up and send progress. next steps??

8/9/15
* sent email with summary of progress and three questions (on HMAC proof 2) to advisors
* meetings with matt/andrew/lennart and with dave
  * need to learn about better crypto models/proofs than the unreliable random oracle proofs in the paper
* transcribed notes and TODOs from meetings

8/10/15
* not much today. TIL: start the day with the most important work (thesis) not the least important (emails)
* posted on zulip about progress. really appreciated katrina's comment on how much of a cool opportunity this is (both to learn and to contribute) + how interesting my work is to an outsider!
* end-of-day: looked at matt's paper, opened wikipedia tab on "provable security." CPA, CCA = ?
  * math gets real in pages 7, 11
* read this SE on cryptographic oracles: they leak partial info https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10617/what-is-a-cryptographic-oracle

8/11/15
* thesis'd early!
* read first few pages of symmetric encryption provable security paper (SEPS)

8/12/15
* thesis'd early!
* read more pages of SEPS paper. understood notation, approaching math... 
* need to read FCF

8/13/15
* nothing: ORF pset, pushed it off until morning

8/14/15
* morning: read next page of SEPS paper (LOR-CPA, CCA definition)
* evening: ~4 hours on paper. definitions are easy, understood semantic security
  * stuck on proof that adv(LOR-CPA) <= 2 adv(ROR-CPA). or is it the other way around? i think the intuition should be easy (solving real-or-random with left-or-right) but i don't understand the oracle simulation. 
  * also looked at XOR proofs. can i understand them? the theorem seems okay
* flipped through new goldreich book
* also: the diffie-hellman CCS paper is incredible
* TODO: FCF paper, FCF code, rest of this paper, go back to HMAC proof and try it

8/15/15
* spent the day on writing my research statement for CRA; decided to sleep early

8/16/15
* read symenc and FCF papers, skyped with matt, learned a lot (see notes)
  * it was very helpful to have understood the LOR/ROR definitions and seen the FCF security proof!
  * what could I have done better? read more of both papers, probably
* transcribed (most of) my notes
