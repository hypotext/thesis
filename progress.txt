9/30/15
* cloned FCF and got it to check
* TODO read ElGamal

9/31/15
* nothing

8/1/15
* started responding to naphat's email
* read his notes
* starting to write email for next week's meeting
* proposal is due next tuesday
  (I should send it Monday morning)
* TODO make a comprehensive TODO list
* TODO thesis every day
* TODO learn probability. read proofs.
* TODO send these two emails ASAP

8/2/15
* responded to naphat's email
* made comprehensive TODO list
* wrote proposal except for related work

8/3/15
* finished proposal and sent it
* sent meeting email
* started reading fcf paper, realized it's not the most impt. thing right now
* read next two pages of HMAC-DRBG paper. lucid up to proof. is it game-based?

8/4/15
* nothing, clashed with ELE pset and CWR assignment

8/5/15
* checked out the two crypto coursera classes; decided on boneh's; watched most of the first lecture on PRGs
* submitted project proposal
* GOAL: watch coursera videos, do the exercises, be able to point to a specific area of HMAC proof that I'm stuck on.

8/6/15
* none, opted to work in morning instead

8/7/15
* morning: finished PRG intro, watched first half of PRG security definitions. we're proving security GIVEN THAT HMAC is secure (given that hash function is secure). actual security would imply P != NP
* night: (~3.5 hrs)
  - finished PRG security defs: adversary as statistical test, secure IFF unpredictable (Yao's theorem)
  - realized that goldwasser (?)'s book is a real and long textbook, not just the 30 pages of notes i have. ordered/downlowded it
  - checked out HMAC proof 1: confusing
  - checked out HMAC proof 2: lucid! random oracle model bad? 
    - hash-based DRBG proof first, then HMAC's?
* TODO: HMAC proof 2, semantic security, el-gamal, game-based crypto reduction proofs, goldwasser book, **figure out where i get stuck on a proof**
